# Ironic Implicature Experiment in PCIbex
Code for implementing an ironic-implicature experiment using Ibex framework in PCIbex

## Objectives
This experiment was conducted to study:
1) are phrases marked with the irony-emoji marker, especially the emoji :roll_eyes:, considered as statements conveying ironic implicature by native speakers of Thai language?
2) is there a significant difference of an average reaction time taken to judge such phrases (marked with the irony-emoji), compared to phrases marked with the ambiguous emoji :smile:? And if such a difference exists, do the phrases with the irony-emoji induce ironic implicature faster than those with the ambiguous one?

## Experiment
To give answers to the two research questions mentioned above, a website for collecting result data was designed following the below sequential structure.
1) Consent Form
2) Participant's Information
3) Instruction
4) Exercise
5) Actual Test
6) End Screen and Gratitude Expression

The consent form, instruction and questions all are written in Thai, you may adapt the contents as appropriate to your participants' language.

## Task Description
All participants are required to give consent to do the test, provide basic information (gender, age, hours of social media consumption, dominant hand) before starting the experiment.

To do the test, participants are instructed to put their two hands on their keyboard. The index finger of their left hand is placed on the F button which will be pressed when participants want to answer Yes. On the other hand, the index finger of their right hand is placed on the J button which will be pressed when they want to answer No.

The Exercise and Actual Test sections comprises of 85 items in total of yes-or-no questions. These items are categorized two types of questions:
1) test question - this type asks participants if a stimulus phrase displayed on the screen is conveying ironic meaning.
2) filler question - this one asks participants if an illustration displayed on the screen matches with a given noun.
The items will be randomly shuffled.

In the Exercise section, it consists of 5 test questions and 5 filler questions, 10 items in total. This section gives participants training so that they become familiar with the process when they do the actual test. Thus, the result obtained from this section will not be included in the analysis.

In the Actual Test, it consists of 30 test questions and 45 filler questions, 75 items in total. This section is where the answers to the test questions are actually collected and analyzed.

Note that participants must give an answer to a question within 5 seconds. Otherwise that current question will be automatically skipped to the next item.

## Acknowledgement
I want to express my gratitude to Dr. Nattanun Chanchaochai, my supervisor for this project. Without her guidance, this whole project would not have been this successful. I also want to thank her student for their generousity to lend me their illustrations (as used in the filler questions).

I hope that this repository will be a useful resource to those who want to conduct an experiment on an online platform. Please feel free to improvise and adapt the code to suit your own experiment.
