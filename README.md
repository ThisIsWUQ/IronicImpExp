# Ironic Implicature Experiment in PCIbex
Code for implementing an ironic-implicature experiment using Ibex framework in PCIbex

## Objectives
This experiment was conducted to study:
1) are phrases marked with the irony-emoji marker, especially the emoji :roll_eyes:, considered as statements conveying ironic implicature by native speakers of Thai language?
2) is there a significant difference of an average reaction time taken to judge such pharses (marked with the irony-emoji), compared to pharses marked with the ambiguous emoji :smile:? And if such a difference exists, do the phrases with the irony-emoji induce ironic implicature faster than those with the ambiguous one?

## Experiment
To give answers to the two research questions mentioned above, a website for collecting reuslt data was designed following the below sequential structure.
1) Consent Form
2) Participant's Information
3) Instruction
4) Exercise
5) Actual Test
6) End Screen and Gratitude Expression
The consent form, instruction and questions all are witten in Thai, you may adapt the contents as appropriate to your participants' language.

## Acknowledgement
I want to express my gratitude to Dr. Nattanun Chanchaochai, my supervisor for this project. Without her guidance, this whole project would not have been this successful. I also want to thank her student for their generousness to lend me their illustrations as used in the filler questions.

I hope that this repository will be a useful resource to those who want to conduct an experiment on an online platform. Please feel free to improvise and adapt the code to suit your own experiment.
