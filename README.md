# Ironic Implicature Experiment in PCIbex
Code for implementing an ironic-implicature experiment in PCIbex

## Objectives
This experiment was conducted to study:
1) are phrases marked with the irony-emoji marker, especially the emoji :roll_eyes:, considered as statements conveying ironic implicature by native speakers of Thai language?
2) is there a significant difference of an average reaction time taken to judge such pharses (marked with the irony-emoji), compared to pharses marked with the ambiguous emoji :smile:? And if such a difference exists, do the pharses with the irony-emoji induce ironic implicature faster than those with the ambiguous one?
## Experiment Design
To give answers to the two research questions mentioned above, a website for collecting reuslt data was designed following the below structure.
1) Consent Form
2) Participant's Information
3) Instruction
4) Exercise
5) Actual Test
6) End Screen and Gratitude Expression

## Contribution
I hope that this repository will be a useful resource to those who want to conduct an experiment on an online platform. Please feel free to improvise and adapt the code to suit your own experiment.
